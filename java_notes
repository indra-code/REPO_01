A super class reference variale can refer to any of its sub class object. But it can only call superclass's inherited methods, but not subclass own methods.
If the subclass overrides its superclass method, this reference calls that method, the sub class version is executed.
The cause for difference in the behaviour of the method call statement is, the instance or object the reference is referring to. And objects are created at runtime, a link is established between method call and definition at runtime. So it is called dynamic linking or dynamic binding The change in the behaviour is known as polymorphism.

Abstract class: Class definition qualified with "abstract" keyword, which can't have instances. The purpose of it is forcing the developer to define subclasses needed to the business and use them.

Abstract method: 
Method of a class don't have a body
The class(which have abstract method) is mandatorily abstract class, which don't allow instatiation. And forces the dev to define subclass and override super class's abstract method
